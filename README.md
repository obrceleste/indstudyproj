For my project, I intend to merge two data sets to analyze the characteristics
of top Netflix movies. One of the data sets contains budget, sales, and production
data, while the other contains Netflix-specific information, including when the 
film was added to Netflix, the genres it is listed under, and cast details. My
goal is to examine how production and financial factors influence may influence 
the length of time after the film's release before it is added to Netflix. I
also intend to identify and analyze trends in budget allocation, genre success,
casting choices, etc. I would also like to find data on the film's critical success
and Netflix viewer ratings, if possible.
